   This is the master list of practice problems.
   I made it by looking at everything done in class, and thinking of
   potential extensions to class problems.

   DO THESE PROBLEMS ON PAPER.
   Do not use LearnOCaml!

   On the exam, you do not have a compiler to check your types, and you
   will lose marks for type errors, bad syntax, etc.

   Of course, to *check* your work, you can type up your solution in
   LearnOCaml and test it. Better yet, compare your solution with a
   classmate and learn from each other!

   Each problem has a ranking with stars.
   - Problems ranked 1 or 2 stars, you should be able to do.
   - Problems ranked 3 or more stars are challenging, and probably
     beyond what you would see on a test.

   It's probably a good idea to at least *attempt* 3-star problems,
   even if you don't feel super comfortable with the material, because
   they will hopefully push the boundaries of your knowledge. But
   don't feel bad if you can't solve them without hints from your
   friends.

   One more remark about the stars: they don't reflect overall
   difficulty of the question. They reflect the difficulty of the
   question among that *type* of question.
   For example, there are 1-star continuation questions as well as
   1-star ordinary recursion questions.
   They are not equally difficult!
   The continuation question may be harder than the recursion
   question, but _for a continuation question_ it's 1-star.

   Problems for each topic are in their own module.

     Hint:
     There are lots of lists. Which one should you do induction on? In
     general, you should do induction on the object that drives the
     computation. In the case of append, you defined it by pattern
     matching and recursion on the first argument, so you should pick
     the first list here.

     For any acc : int and any l : int mylist,

     in 1 or two lines by invoking the generalized theorem.

  (* You'll notice that the only think *specific* to addition that we
     needed in the previous theorem was associativity. This suggests a
     natural generalization of the previous theorem.

     THEOREM.
     Suppose f : 'a -> 'a -> 'a is an associative function, i.e.
     for any x, y, z of type 'a, we have f (f x y) z = f x (f y z)
     (For example, (+) is such a function.)
     Suppose further that e : 'a is an identity of f, i.e.
     for all x : 'a, f e x = f x e = x.
     (For example, 0 is an identity of (+).)
     Then, for any l : 'a list, we have
     fold_right f l e = fold_left f e l

     You can't prove this theorem directly; it must be generalized.
     It is generalized in a similar way to the previous theorem, so
     try to work out the generalization yourself.
     If you get stuck, take a look at the induction practice problem
     set posted for Midterm 1. It has this problem on it, and a
     solution for it.

     = [(x1, x2); (x2, x3); (x3, x4); (x4; x5)]

  (* I know I said no more folds, but I can't help myself.

     a variable x.

     The NR method begins with an initial guess x0 and produces a
     refinement of the guess, x1. This refinement is then used as the
     next guess, and so on, until we reach a guess x' such that f(x')

     Consider f(x') to be sufficiently close if it is within 0.001 of

  (** In mathematics, a sequence is defined as a function from the

  (** The Wallis product, published in 1656, is an infinite product
      whose limit is pi/2. It is among the oldest known ways to
      calculate pi to arbitrary precision.

      It is defined as:
      (2/1 * 2/3) * (4/3 * 4/5) * (6/5 * 6/7) * (8/7 * 8/9) * ...

      Notice that the nth factor in the product is given by the
      formula:

      a_n = 2n/(2n-1) * 2n/(2n+1)
          = 4n^2/(4n^2 - 1)
      (Remark: this sequence begins at n=1 !)

      Denote by W_n the Wallis product truncated at factor n.
      So W_1 = a_1 = 2/1 * 2/3
      W_2 = a_2 * W_1
      W_3 = a_3 * W_2 = a_3 * a_2 * a_1
      and so on.
